# MSc.Project
This is the GitHub repository for my MSc. project titled "Integration of AI Breast Cancer Prediction into The OpenMRS System". This repository contains all the project components including the developed web application, deployed AI model, Interview resources and wireframe designs.

The aim of this project is to extend the OpenMRS system by providing a prediction tool for Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) through the integration of an AI model.
